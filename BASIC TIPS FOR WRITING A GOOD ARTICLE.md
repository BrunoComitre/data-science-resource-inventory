# Basic tips for writing a good article

**Observation** - I don't know who sent me or where I received it from, I just know that it deserves to be passed on, if anyone knows the creator of that text, I would like to reference it.

In times of optimization for search engines, multiplatform blogs and large volume of information available, it is increasingly difficult to know what is necessary to write a good article. For me, the essentials of a good article are the following:

1. Have content
2. Be understandable by someone
3. Be useful to someone

<br />

## Have content

It is quite common to copy and paste texts from other sites without asking permission from the author of the text. This, in addition to being unethical, is illegal when the site does not have a sharing policy open to this practice.

If you have no idea what you are going to write in an article or how often you are going to write it, it is better not to even create a blog. Create a microblog, or an album of images, but stay away from blogs.

<br />

## Be understandable by someone

Currently browsers such as Google Chrome already have native features to facilitate the translation of entire pages with just one click, however the translations are not always faithful to the original text. Therefore, when you create a blog you need to keep the following in mind:

1. What will your target audience be
2. Where is the best place to find it
3. What is the best language to reach this audience

<br />

## Be useful to someone

The main objectives of communication are the transmission and preservation of information. Nowadays the duration of information preservation is getting shorter, but that deserves a specific article on the subject.

Thus, the main objective of communication should be the transmission of information, whether for you, for people close to you or for people on the other side of the world or even outside our atmosphere.

The transmission of information becomes valuable when it is useful to the recipient. That was my seventh tip for writing a good article.
