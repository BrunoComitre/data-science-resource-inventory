## Motivation

This is a repository of shortcuts to start studying **Data Science**.

**An important addendum is that I intend to focus on the security area. So, in this repository I will have a part where I will leave some links and information sheets focused on Information Security.**

We start with a What is Data Science ?. Basic readings for you to understand more about what Data Science is and what I must study to be a professional desired by companies.

The next steps are separated into Courses (MOOCs), for learning; Data set for study; Blogs that bring together the hottest and most up-to-date topics in the area, computer links for general knowledge; Youtube links to the best courses mentioned by the community; tools for producing analysis; online magazines; links to books for study and to buy; sites that gather competitions to increase the skills of Data Scientist; Main tool tutorials; Some of the best lists and repositories for studying Data Science; search links.

The idea of the list is not to make me a Unicorn Data Scientist, but when I am a Data Scientist I have a In the hall of everything that encompasses the area, and can talk to the various professionals involved in the area so that manage to define the best projects and approaches to which I will work.

References have been gathered here that have appeared throughout the studies and from various researches to facilitate studies and understanding. It is not a step by step to become a Data Scientist, but it serves as a Guide for those seeking knowledge in the field, and a repository for easy access without having your browser full of disorganized favorites.

So it follows a structure where I will address about:

- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer

**Data Engineer**
Responsible for taking raw data from various sources and placing the data in a Data Lake, a database where other team members will access. Responsible for bringing, processing and making data available from different sources in one place for the team. In some places known as Big Data Developer, who would be a Data Engineer, someone who will make the data available, but who has knowledge in Big Data, that is, has knowledge of programs that will work with large data sets such as Apache Spark or Apache Hadoop. The function of the Data Lake is only to store the data, the treatment will be done at the time of reading the data. The idea of Data Lake is because a Data Warehouse has data processed and cleaned, it would take longer and consequently lose data / value. A Data Pipeline architecture supports batch and processing and real-time. When talking about a distributed system, we are not necessarily talking only about the Hadoop architecture.

**Data Scientist**
Responsible for taking the data provided by the Data Engineer and rationalizing that data. Take the data and create Machine Learning models to solve the problems. Create Prediction Models or Classification Algorithms to solve some things. You take the information that is likely to be inside a Data Lake, and the Data Scientist will streamline these things, streamline these models and try to find the best model possible to improve the results. It is the guy who will be trying to rationalize the data, think about the best solutions and try to solve the problems.

**Machine Learning Engineer**
He comes to put the model that Data Scientist created in Production. It basically takes the model that the Data Scientist and puts it in a scalable way.

<br />

## Introductory Area

**First**
Learn Python:

You don't need to know Python in PRO mode, for example, but to enter this world you need certain basic knowledge:

- Don't you know Python? I highly recommend Gustavo Guanabara from [Curso em VÃ­deo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/curso-python-3/)
- All about Python [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)
- Tools link to learn: [developer script](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

**Second**
Prepare the PC:

I suggest Anaconda Navigator for those who are starting their studies in this field. It is Open Source for the programming languages Python and R. And it has all the necessary tools.

- Python can be downloaded through the Anaconda distribution: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

- Now, you can also use an IDE. I particularly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Third**
Libraries:

The following are some libraries dedicated to the study of Data Science. There are several libraries that can be used, facilitating data analysis. Some must-have libraries for learning:

- [**Numpy**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy) - Library for arrays and mathematical functions.
- [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/downloads.html) - For plotting graphs and visualizing data.
- [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/releases.html) - For viewing and editing images via Python.
- [**Virtualenv**](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) - It is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic problem to be solved is one of the dependencies and versions and indirectly permissions.
- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - It is an Open Source library, licensed by BSD, that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- [**CharmPy**](https://charmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - It is a high level parallel and distributed programming framework with a simple and powerful API, based on Python migrable objects and remote method invocation; built on top of an adaptable C / C ++ runtime system that provides speed, scalability and dynamic load balancing.
- [**Pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - It is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in the Python programming language.
- [**SciPy**](https://www.scipy.org/) - It is an Open Source library in Python language that was made for mathematicians, scientists and engineers.
- [**Urllib**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) - It is a Python module for searching URLs.
- [**Beautiful Soup**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - It is a Python package for analyzing HTML and XML documents.
- [**Papermill**](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) - A tool to parameterize, execute and analyze Jupyter Notebooks.
- [**Nteract**](https://github.com/nteract/nteract) - It is a dynamic tool to give flexibility when writing code, exploring data and creating text to share insights about the data.
- [**RISE**](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/installation.html) - "Live" Reveal.js Jupyter / IPython slide show extension.
- [**Scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Python library with all kinds of algorithms.

**Note:**
For those who want to deal with neural networks / Deep Learning, it is another trail. There are four major frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and Theano. TensorFolw being the most known and used.

**Fourth**
TensorFlow:

First, get to know [Playground Tensorflow](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)

After reading this material, it's time for installation:

  - Install CUDA Toolkit, and check that the system variables are correct.
  - Install CUDA Toolkit drivers
  - Install cuDNN
  - Install TensorFlow, CPU or GPU version (preferably only one installation)

When installing, follow own step-by-step instructions  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

> **An addendum: as you can see, the focus is on NVIDIA. Regarding the AMD GPU, I am unaware.**

Installed? Tested it? Did it roll? Now you don't know where to start? Here are tips:

  - There are own tutorials on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
  - A tutorial for base [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers)
  - A tutorial for base [CIFAR-10](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn)

In the tutorials this is clear, but I reinforce: learn to use the TensorBoard, manager and viewer of the TensorFlow neural networks. Until you save the current network status to reload later, you can:

  - [TensorFlow Summaries and Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
  - [Swiss AI Lab IDSIA](http://ischlag.github.io/about/)

**Fifth:**
Some more things

- Your account [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) is mandatory.
- Short list of databases to use as a guide. It has on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_research)
- Historical and classic databases. It has in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

**Valuable Tips **
Below are some tips for you to go on your way:

1. Know the trail made by Leonardo Ferreira who in 1 year and a half became a data scientist and is in the 30th position worldwide as a data scientist [Kaggle] (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-science- from-zero-kaggle-kernel-master-leonardo-ferreira /).
2. Organize your studies and don't mix or try to absorb many of the teachings.
3. Have profiles on Linkedin, GitHub, Kaggle and Hacker Rank. Have a Twitter developer account for text mining.
4. Go deeper by drinking teaching from various sources! example: when studying Python, read e-books and several other materials from different sources because each course has a different didactic and if you "pack" in some ok subject, it is common: look for other didactics until you understand.
5. If you want and can, invest in paid courses and specializations.
6. Use and learn with concept maps

***

**Kind of obligatorily, understand:**

- Predictive modeling.
- Naive Bayes.
- Time Series Analysis and Visualization.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Statistics.
- Univariate analysis.
- Bivariate analysis.
- Graphics for when and how to use.
- Qualitative and Quantitative Variables.
- Basic mathematical requirements ..
- Notions of analytical and numerical optimization.
- Discover tools for data extraction on the web.
- Basics of linear algebra, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, base changes, among others.
- Basic probability and statistics: conditional probability, basic formulas, most common distributions, basic metrics, regression, rË2, p-value, inference, among others.
- It is worth knowing the least about: Amazon AWS server and Amazon QuickSight and Microsoft Power BI.
- And also: version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R and RStudio.

Like anything you want to learn, you should get involved with it, and a tip is always do not try to understand everything at once, take it easy. Frequent communities. The Python community in Brazil is one of the strongest and most active I have ever seen.

And that's it: this is the Area's Introductory Package. You are now able to start experimenting with the area.

***

**Comments:**

- The above script is not the only and not necessarily the best way to learn; it reflects what I intend to acquire as knowledge and I have noted in meetings and lectures and conversations in my career in the area.
